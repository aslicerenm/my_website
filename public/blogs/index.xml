      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Asli. I was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1996. I studied Economics at Bogazici University and held a leadership position at a student club. During my Undergraduate education, I also did part- and full-time internships at various multinational companies such as L&amp;rsquo;Oréal and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble. I graduated in 2020 and started working as a Jr. Digital Growth Specialist in one of the largest e-commerce companies in Turkey. In August 2021, I started studying at LBS and am currently a part of the MAM2022 cohort.</description>

Here we will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.
