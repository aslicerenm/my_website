Hi, I'm Asli. I was born in Istanbul, Turkey in 1996. I studied Economics at Bogazici University and held a leadership position at a student club. During my Undergraduate education, I also did part- and full-time internships at various multinational companies such as L'Or√©al and Procter & Gamble. I graduated in 2020 and started working as a Jr. Digital Growth Specialist in one of the largest e-commerce companies in Turkey. In August 2021, I started studying at LBS and am currently a part of the MAM2022 cohort.
