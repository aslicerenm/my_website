# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. Here we will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
skim(yrbss)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. 

*Analysis*: The distribution of weights appears to be skewed right and 1004 observations are missing.

```{r, eda_on_weight, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}

mosaic::favstats(~weight, data=yrbss)

ggplot(data=yrbss, aes(weight)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(
    title = "Density plot of weight in kg",
    x = "Weight",
    y = "Density")

```

Next, we consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

```{r, weight and physical activity , fig.width=5, fig.height=6}

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(weight), !is.na(physically_active_7d)) %>% 
  
ggplot(aes(x=physically_active_7d, y=weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~physically_active_7d, scales="free")+
  theme_minimal()+
   labs(
    title = "Boxplot of weight depending on physical active 7 days",
    x = "Physical active 7 days",
    y = "Weight")

```
```{r, weight and physical activity_2 , fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(weight), !is.na(physically_active_7d)) %>% 
  
ggplot(aes(x=weight, group=physically_active_7d, color= physically_active_7d)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  theme_minimal()+
   labs(
    title = "Density plot of weight depending on physical active 7 days",
    x = "Weight",
    y = "Density")

```


Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. We also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. 

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}

yrbss  <- yrbss %>% mutate(physical_3plus=case_when(physically_active_7d>2 ~ "yes", 
                                          physically_active_7d<3 ~"no" )) 
  

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>%  
  mutate(percentage=count/sum(count)*100)

```

We construct a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week

```{r, ci for population proportion}
n_target <- yrbss %>% filter( physically_active_7d < 3) %>% 
  count()
n <- yrbss %>% count()
p <- n_target / n
se <- sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)
lower = p - 1.96 * se
upper = p + 1.96 * se
lower
upper
```

We make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. 

While one would believe that people who exercise more, weight less, this can not be clearly seen from the graphs. One potential reason might be that muscles actually weight more so that "fitter" people weight more than just skinny people.


```{r, boxplot, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}

yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=physical_3plus, y=weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of weight depending on physical active 3+ days",
    x = "Physical active 3+ days",
    y = "Weight")

```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>%
  mutate(physical_active_numeric = case_when(
  physical_3plus  == "yes" ~ 1, 
  physical_3plus  == "no" ~ 0 )) %>% 

  summarise(mean=mean(physical_active_numeric), 
            sd=sd(physical_active_numeric), 
            count=n(), 
            se = sqrt(mean*(1-mean)/count),  
            t_critical=qt(0.975, count - 1 ), 
            lower = mean-t_critical*se, 
            upper = mean+t_critical*se)

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

difference = mean(weight of people who exercise 3+) + mean(weight of people who exercise less than 3)
H0: difference = 0
H1: difference != 0 

```{r, t_test_using_R}

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```

## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. We will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}

obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

After we have initialized the test, we need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r, fig.height=4, fid.width=6}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  theme_minimal()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`.

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r, fig.height=4, fid.width=6}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```
